# Backend for E-commerce Brand

> This repo builds out the API for a frontend. We scaled the app's architecture to support loads of up to tens of thousands of requests per second.

## Build Process
• Analyzed and compared multiple database options; selected Postgres</br>
• Transformed the existing application data and loaded it into the database</br>
• Designed and built an API server to provide data to the client in the format specified by the API documentation</br>
• Optimized services by analyzing query times and server responses</br>
• Deployed services using Docker and integrated it with frontend</br>
• Measured and improved the performance of the services at scale</br>
• Worked as a team and scale the application's architecture to support loads up to tens of thousands of requests per second
